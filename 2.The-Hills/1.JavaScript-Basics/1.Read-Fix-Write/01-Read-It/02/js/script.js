// This constant gives a variable - its name is 'amount' and the value of 'amount' is 20. 
const amount = 20;

//The document write creates text on the page, the use of amount means that the number 20 is inserted in the text
document.write("<h1>Top " + amount + " Greatest Movies of All Time</h1>");

//The same happens here except they have performed a mathamatical process on the amount and so it displays as 10 instead of the const value 20
document.write(`<h2>The first ${amount / 2} movies</h2>`);
